## About

This is a blog about Economics, Philosophy, Public Policy, conceptions of suffering, European Politics, sentience, international security and miscallaneous topics I find intriguing

- I am trying to reduce my confusion about the world 
- eveltually figuring out how to make the world a better place.

Please let me know if you ahve any comments or sugggestions. Thats the reason for the existence of this blog.

I worry about the [future of humanity](https://github.com/KingFelix/emerald/), [poverty and animals](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2018/02/the-psychology-of-speciesism-how-we-privilege-certain-animals-over-others/)   and  [want to help as much as possible](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZpDnRCeef2CLEFeKM/money-the-unit-of-caring).



I became convinced that sometime randomizing search can be the best way of getting out of local maxima. Hence, I mostly write about more or less random things I wonder about but I have never really had the chance to think about them a lot  so I pretty much scratch at the surface.
