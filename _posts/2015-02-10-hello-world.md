Please let me know if you ahve any comments or sugggestions. Thats the reason for the existence of this blog.

I am here to put my writing out there


This is a blog about Economics, Philosophy, Public Policy, conceptions of suffering, European Politics, sentience, international security - trying to reduce my confusion figuring out how to make the world a better place.


I became convinced that sometime randomizing search can be the best way of getting out of local maxima. Hence, I mostly write about more or less random things I wonder about but I have never really had the chance to think about them a lot  so I pretty much scratch at the surface.

I worry about the future of humanity (hyperlink longtermism), inaction (hyperlink dArius post), poverty and animals (hyperlink speciesims)  and want to help as much as possible (hyperlink EA)
