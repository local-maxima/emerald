title: Epistemic Injustice
---
I find it still shocking knowing that income-wise I will probably be part of the 1 or 2% richest people. In purchasing power in the world. 
It is good to remind me regularly of those privileges and the opportunities and responsibilities that come with it: (giving what we can)

But maybe there are also other forms of injustice, another form of a wrong distribution of resources, the human capability as a knower.

I recently read Miranda Fricker about epistemic injustices and this made me aware of problems I underestimated. 

Fricker first defines testimonial justice. I will explain it with a personal example:

My aunt never wanted to be called a Dr..  As a child, I was puzzled by this fact. I saw a lot of other people in suits who called themselves Dr. dr. and I didnt understant why my aunt wanted to “miss out” on the credibility she would experience.
I didint fully grasp that testimonial epistemic injustice, the ability to be perceived as a “knower” is similar to other forms of distributional injustice. 
And we are responsible not to take too much from the cake and to make sure that everyone ahs equal opportunity to be perceived as a knower.

I am still figuring out what I can do in my life to reduce epistemically unjust outcomes. Perhaps, this means that .
This also applies to invitation for panels and other speaker events etc. (no manel).
